# Tableau-Public-Vizzes
Code to extract data about all your vizzes on Tableau Public

Note: Tableau Public made changes to their public APIs which have rendered this code largely useless. If you want to get your stats, I'd suggest signing up for my Tableau Public Stats Service: https://www.flerlagetwins.com/2021/03/stats-service.html
